- Review: Great guy! We called in a panic on Saturday to fix a blown hose reel. Even though they were busy he squeezed us in and got us back to work to finish. Thank you so much!

- Review: Clarke Engineering was recommended by another local businessâ€¦ I brought my backhoe cylinder to have the seals replaced. They took good care to replace the seals and clean up the cylinder a bit. I was happy with the workmanship. Thank you, Brian

- Review: We had a small bracket that needed welding. My husband works all business hours so I had to bring the little piece down with my helpful 10yr old daughter and two young boys. It is not a place to unload my boys so I sent my daughter in to ask about fixing it. They were AMAZING!! They were so great with her, the sweetest people, fixed up our little bracket for a minimal fee and even let my daughter pick out a little toy each for her brothers waiting in the car with me. This is how every business should be run. So kind, friendly, helpful. I was very impressed!!

- Review: Have been dealing with Dave for many years and he never disappoints. I had a small custom job that was time sensitive and they knocked it out of the park in time, cost and function.
