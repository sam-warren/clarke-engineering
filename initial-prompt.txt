Updates from Sam
2025-05-02: Called with Logan to get initial site requirements clarified, agreed upon first pass skeleton site with navigation, styling, placeholder text. ETA mid-week (2025-05-07).

Updates from Logan
May 12 2025. Let’s forget about the restaurant angle and let’s instead get our core target audience locked down:
-Heavy Duty Equipment Repairs 
-Elevator and Crane Repairs 
-Truck and Automotive repair 
-Construction projects
-Public / Municipal / Government projects 
-Marine Engineering projects 

Let’s have tiles for each of these categories from the main landing page.

The vibe: 
To make a non-boring, awesome website that radiates energy and keeps people engaged, you need to nail five core elements:

1. 
Voice & Vibe: Be Human
Speak directly to the visitor. Drop the corporate tone. Be playful, bold, confident—whatever suits your brand.


Example: Instead of “We provide quality service,” say “We fix your mess before it becomes a disaster.”


Welding gun icon with caption, 👨‍🏭 “ fastest guns in the West” 

2. 
Visual Energy: Design with Personality
Colors: Use bold, unexpected color combos (but keep it readable).


Fonts: Choose modern, expressive typography—not the same old Arial or Times.


Movement: Subtle animations, hover effects, or microinteractions add life.


Images/Videos: Use real, high-quality visuals with people, action, or emotion.



3. 
Structure: Guide, Don’t Bore
Break the mold of standard layouts. Try asymmetry, scroll effects, or unexpected transitions.


Use sections with punchy headlines, fast scannable chunks, and clear calls to action.


Keep the homepage lean. Don’t try to say everything—make people want to click deeper.



4. 
Content: Make It Fun to Read
Write like you’re telling a story at a bar, not delivering a PowerPoint.


Use humor, confidence, or even a little rebellion—depending on your brand.


Include interactive elements (polls, quizzes, sliders, before/after reveals, etc.)



5. 
Speed & Mobile: Performance is Sexy
A fast site with snappy transitions feels exciting.


Make sure it’s optimized for mobile—most people are visiting on their phones.



Bonus Ideas:
Sticky callouts or messages that follow as you scroll.


Custom cursor or click effects that react to the user.


Live chat or chatbot that fits the brand voice (quirky, honest, sarcastic, etc.).


A splash of mystery: “What’s behind this?” interactions can encourage exploration.
Concept:
The website should feel fast, like woosh, everything is faster than normal website, hovering over something for a second will instantly flash to the next screen. Background features like Sam has on his website will woosh by. We’re a fast repair service and our website should give an impression of speed. 

Reference sites:
https://clarke.islandnet.com 

Sites I found that are trying to achieve a similar presence. Under each site put features to add/copy from
https://www.lditechs.com


https://www.keyfood.ca 


https://imperialwelding.com


https://www.greatwestwelding.com 
 
https://www.junctiontech.ca/

New direction based on how Sam has made his website with clean uncluttered layout and use of Icons:



Logo idea for the sub-pages, just ‘Clarke’ in the fire truck red oval with white around the outside. It would need to be centered better. Like ‘Coke’ or ‘Mack’.








Call notes 16/4/2025

Let’s copy the icons from Great West using reserve search. Let’s use these Icons to say what we do without needing wordy sentences. Example Hydraulic Repairs (Icon picture of Hydraulic fluid drip or whatever if you have a better idea)

icons/buttons:
-elevator repairs odne



-crane repairs 


-heavy duty cylinder repairs



-line boring repairs


-hydraulic repairs


-bearing and pulley repairs

-Island Equipment Operators Association Member badge:

Let’s use real photos from local work done completed like:
- Bastion Square Arch

Let’s have ‘66 years of excellence in Victoria’ pop up as soon as the page loads like Keyfood has

Let’s use Google review plug-in for more trust on the reviews and Let’s use a Google map plug-in to show where we are. 

Let’s remove the wordy sentence at the top of the landing page. 

Please put call to action phone and email address and business address at the top of every page and floating.Let’s make the call to action button sticky aka floating, it should stay on the page as you scroll through the website, ‘call now: 250 475 2400’ + ‘email now: clarke@islandnet.com’

Photos: Ideas:

Also some cool photos of the guys machining/working with the Clarke logos promoinant & visible on the overalls and hats 
For the photos, possibly shot in black and white but with the red Clarke logo in full colour so it pops
Also a map in the footer which shows Uptown and downtown with a little Star ⭐️ showing our location
