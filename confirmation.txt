## 5. Design & UX ("Vibe")
- **Overall Feel:** Non-boring, awesome, radiates energy, keeps people engaged, fast, modern.
- **Voice & Tone:** Human, direct, playful, bold, confident. Avoid corporate speak.
- **Visual Energy:**
    - Colors: Bold, unexpected combos (readable). Fire Truck Red prominent.
    - Fonts: Modern, expressive typography.
    - Movement: Subtle animations, hover effects, microinteractions. Fast transitions ("woosh" effect).
    - Images/Videos: Real, high-quality visuals (people, action, emotion). Background videos in hero.
- **Structure:** Break standard layouts (asymmetry, scroll effects, unexpected transitions). Punchy headlines, scannable chunks, clear CTAs. Lean homepage.
- **Content:** Storytelling, humor, confidence.
- **Performance:** Fast site, snappy transitions, mobile-optimized.
- **Icons:** Use icons effectively to convey services (e.g., similar to Great West Welding's use of icons).
    - Specific icons mentioned: elevator repairs, crane repairs, heavy-duty cylinder repairs, line boring, hydraulic repairs, bearing/pulley repairs, truck repairs, tanker repairs, paving equipment, excavators, bulldozers, etc.
- **Custom Cursor/Click Effects:** Consider for enhanced interaction.
- **Sticky Callouts/Messages:** As user scrolls.

## 6. Styling & Implementation Details
- **Styling:** Inline TailwindCSS within component files. No external CSS files.
- **No external JS files** (unless for specific, approved integrations like a chat widget, which seems contradictory to "no external libraries/APIs" - see section 8).
- **Animations & Transitions:** Prioritize beauty and smoothness.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Crucial.

## 7. Development Process Notes
- Start with a skeleton site: navigation, styling, placeholder text.
- Iterative development, especially for service division pages (Lorem Ipsum first).
- Focus on visual appeal and user engagement first.

## 8. Specific Component/Feature Notes & Constraints
- **Shadcn Components:** Use `pnpx shadcn@latest add <component>` to install new components.
- **"66 years of excellence" pop-up:** Implement on homepage load.
- **Video Background:** Hero section, using files from `public/videos`.
- **Testimonials:** Rotating, sourced from Google Reviews.
- **Icons for Services:** Reverse search for inspiration from Great West Welding or create/find suitable ones.
- **Google Review Plug-in / Google Map Plug-in:** The prompt mentions these but also states "Do not use any external APIs" and "Do not use any external services." This is a contradiction.
    - **Clarification Needed:** Can we use iframe embeds for Google Maps and a third-party widget for reviews (which might involve external JS/API)? Or should these be static representations (e.g., an image for the map, manually curated testimonials)?
    - **Assumption for now:** Will aim for solutions that minimize external dependencies. For maps, a static image or a very lightweight JS library that doesn't call external APIs might be an option if a true "plug-in" is out. For reviews, they will be manually added and rotated.
- **Live Chat:** Mentioned as a "Bonus Idea" (quirky, honest, sarcastic). Also potentially an external service. Decision needed.
- **Online Booking/Newsletter Signup:** "Victoria Restaurant Repairs" section mentions "Request a Quote" buttons and "The Grease Drip" newsletter signup. This might imply backend or third-party service integration (e.g., for email capture).
    - **Clarification Needed:** How should these be implemented without external services/APIs? A simple `mailto:` link for quotes? For newsletter, is a simple form that does nothing (placeholder) acceptable, or is there a specific non-external method in mind?
- **Domain Forwarding:** Not directly part of the site build, but noted for client information.
- **No external libraries/APIs/services:** This is a strong constraint and will guide implementation choices for features like maps, reviews, chat, and forms.

## 9. Understanding Confirmation
This document serves as confirmation of understanding the requirements outlined in `initial-prompt.txt`. Development will proceed based on this plan once any necessary clarifications (especially regarding external service integrations) are addressed. The primary goal is a visually stunning, fast, and engaging website for Clarke Engineering & Welding Ltd. and its "Victoria Restaurant Repairs & Welding" division.
